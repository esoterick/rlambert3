### Hi there, I'm Robert Lambert. An experienced Site Reliability and Systems Engineer.

I wrote my first computer program over 20 years ago on a Commodore 64 in BASIC, which inspired me to gain my college accreditation in Computer Information Systems, and pursue a professional career in this field. Now, with over 13 years of professional, real-world experience, I find myself constantly in search of knowledge and new skill sets. Most recently, Iâ€™ve taken pride in working on multiple new teams as the need arises to assist in improving the stability and reliability of systems at DigitalOcean.

- I am currently working as a **Senior Infrastructure Engineer II** @ [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)
