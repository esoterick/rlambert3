I wrote my first computer program over 20 years ago on a Commodore 64 in BASIC, which inspired me to gain my college accreditation in Computer Information Systems, and pursue a professional career in this field. Now, with over ten years of professional, real-world experience, I find myself constantly in search of knowledge and new skill sets. Most recently, I've taken pride in harnessing and growing my leadership skills by working across multiple teams to solve complex distributed problems, in addition to solo projects.
