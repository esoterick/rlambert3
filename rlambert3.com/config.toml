With over a decade of real world experience under my belt, I wrote my first computer program over 20 years ago on a Commodore 64 in BASIC.

This has forced me to step up and become a natural leader. Wether I am working with multiple teams solving complex distributed problems or deep diving an issue on my own I tackle problems head on.
